// Package gregorian provides utility functions for the Gregorian calendar calculations.
// The Gregorian calendar was officially introduced in October 1582 so, strictly speaking,
// it only applies after that date. Some countries did not switch to the Gregorian calendar
// for many years after (such as Great Britain in 1782).
//
// Extending the Gregorian calendar backwards to dates preceding its official introduction
// produces a proleptic calendar that should be used with some caution for historic dates
// because it can lead to confusion.
